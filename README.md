# Project-Agricultural-Production-Optimization-Engine-
This is a project completed during my internship at AZ.AGR. NICOSIA CARMELA where I applied machine learning techniques for crop yield prediction using Python
This project has led to 15,2% increase in crop yield accuracy compared to previous methods, resulting in more efficient resource allocation. Prediction errors have diminished by 20,1% through rigorous hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, enhancing yield forecasting precision
